# Tapberry

This group project accomplished in under two weeks as a summer project for my first year at Imperial College London is a quick take on the famous iOS game Tap Tap Revenge, meant to run in the underperformant Raspberry Pi.

It still works on any computer though! Try it out yourself, just clone this project, click on main and watch the magic happen.
